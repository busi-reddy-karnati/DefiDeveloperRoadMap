Now that we have seen how the Bitcoin Network works and how transactions
are facilitated in the network, let's go further. If we look at Bitcoin Network,
that is only used for transacting value and doesn't give much use case to
leverage the power of cryptography and blockchain.

## Some Insights 
With that, rolled out Ethereum Network. It is also called as a giant Computer,
A world computer if you will. It is worthwhile to think of the world we live in as
a combination of transaction. Every transaction happening, changes the state of the world
and there is some value associated with that. From a Computer Science standpoint,
if you are not aware of [Finite State Machines](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/dsa_toc_fsm?examBoard=all&stage=all) 
, [Turing Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DILF8usqp7M&ab_channel=Computerphile) and [Turing Completeness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPQD7-AOjMI&ab_channel=Computerphile) , please revise the topics.
